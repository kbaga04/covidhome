## CovidTracker Application

This application was created using the React.js JavaScript Library and multiple API's. There are three pages in this application: Home, About, and Safety Page. The Home Page displays all the current numbers of COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in almost all countries of the world. The About page contains information about the current COVID-19 crisis and the reason behind creating the project. Finally, the Safety Page includes Safety Tips provided by WHO and CDC in order for people to minimize the chance of contracting the virus.

## Why Did I Create This Project?
  I have created this project out of my deep interest in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also wanted to use my knowledge to educate people on the current crisis.
